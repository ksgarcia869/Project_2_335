The following code contains a function that is used to find the Fibonacci sequence to the 20 terms and holds functions that display equation 1, equation 2, and equation 3. Equation one holds the function  𝐹𝑛 = ((1+√5)𝑛−(1−√5)𝑛)/ 2𝑛√5. Equation 2 holds 𝐹𝑛 ≈𝐹𝑝 (1+√5/2 )^𝑛−𝑝  and Equation 3 holds 𝐹𝑛+1 ≈𝐹𝑛 (1+√5/2 ). Equation 1 is called by the functions of equation 2 and equation 3. The user will have to input p for equation 2 which is a positive integer value and input n for the n terms. The after inputting the two numbers, the code will print out a sequence of numbers from equations 2 and 3 up to the 20 terms. For equation 2, the p value is set by the current iteration of the loop - 1. The code will prompt the user again for p and n value that will print out the a value from equation 2 and equation 3. The code will display several numbers of the following n terms and finally, will execute the largest sum subarray function. The function will print out the largest subarray from arrays (-3, -5, 5, -1, -3, 1, 5, -6), (10, 2, -5, 1, 9, 0, -4, 2, -2), (-7, 1, 8, 2, -3, 1), (9, 7, 2, 16, -22, 11), and (6,1, 9, -33, 7, 2, 9, 1, -3, 8, -2, 9, 12, -4). The user will be able to enter in their array that will print out the largest sum sub-array.
